=================

An API key allow a user or a program to make API calls
without having to authenticate with username and password.
To access an end-point using an API key a client should send the access token
using the ApiKey authentication scheme.

.. code-block:: bash

   GET /resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.hopsworks.ai
   Authorization: ApiKey <api_key>

API key Security
----------------
Treat your secret API key as you would any other password:

1. Give API key the minimum required scope.
2. If an API key is stolen delete and recreate it.
3. Save your API key in a secure place.
4. You can't recover a lost API key.

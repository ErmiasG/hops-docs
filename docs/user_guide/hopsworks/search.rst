Search
========================

You can search on the navigation bar for Datasets, Projects, Feature Groups, Features, and Training datasets.
The search bar behaves differently depending on whether you are on the landing page or inside a project. When you are on the landing page, as we can see from the below image, search can return any items that have not been marked explicitly as private when they were created. That is, unless you mark your Datasets, Features, Feature Groups, and Training Datasets private, they can be discovered (but not necessarily accessed) from the landing page.

In the case of searching on the landing page, as we can see in the image above, your search will target all items that have not been marked explicitly as being private when they were created. By default all the metadata of items (Projects, Datasets, Feature Groups, Features, Training Datasets) are public and searchable by all users in the cluster. The data however is always private and requires access granting by the owners in order to gain access to it. When searching globally you can narrow your search to the categories: Projects/Datasets/Featurestore (Featuregroup, Features and Training Datasets) by selecting the appropriate drop down option.

In the case of searching in the project dashboard, your search will target all items that this project has access to (access to their data) - this includes items that were created within this project as well as items that have been shared with this project. When searching within the project you can narrow your search to the categories: Datasets/Featurestore (Featuregroup, Features and Training Datasets).

Search results are divided in six tabs:

* Featuregroup

* Training dataset

* Feature 

* Projects

* Datasets

* Others (Directories and Files) 

Results will also have highlighted the reason why they matched your search query:

* Featuregroup
	* Name
	* Description
	* Tags
	* Features
* Training dataset
	* Name
	* Description
	* Tags
* Feature 
	* Name
* Projects
    * Name
    * Description
* Datasets
    * Name
    * Description
    * Metadata
* Others (Datasets) 
	* Name

When you search from the landing page, if you discover an interesting item, you can click on the name or "Request access" menu in order to send a request to be granted access. When requesting access you need to provide a project that you want to save this shared item in. If the owner of the item accepts your request, you will now be able to access its contents from the project you selected.

When searching globally if you have access to a particular item, you can see the link icon beside the name. In the case of shared items it can be the case that you can access this item from multiple projects, which is why you can select to which project you want to navigate to.

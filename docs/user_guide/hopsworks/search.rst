Search
========================

The search on the navigation bar can be used to search for Projects, Datasets, Feature groups, Training datasets, and features.
Depending on the page you are in, landing page or project dashboard, the search scope will cover all projects or the specific project you are in.
Search results are divided in four tabs:

* Featuregroup

* Training dataset

* Feature 

* Others (Project and Datasets) 
  
Featuregroup, Training dataset and Feature results can be used to request access or navigate to the featurestore or training dataset
containing the result. Dataset results can also be used to navigate to a dataset, if you have access to it, or to request access to the dataset.
